## Runing this model in the Finisterrae supercomputer

This folder contains code to run the CSER squiggle.c model on the Finisterrae supercomputer, with the help of Jorge Sierra. Partly this is because the question of whether the result changes as we move upwards from 1M samples to 1B and 1T samples is potentially relevant to some hefty donation decisions. But also, it's just intrinsically a fun project. This readme will later transition into a blogpost.
